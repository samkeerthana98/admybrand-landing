#   AI Usage Report

##  AI Tools I Used

- **Bolt.new** – Used to generate the initial project layout with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and component structure. It helped me scaffold the entire landing page quickly.
- **ChatGPT** – Helped me understand and fix errors (like `npm install` issues), guided scroll-to-section behavior, GitHub setup, and helped me polish the README and this report.
- **GitHub Copilot** – Supported code suggestions while building and customizing reusable components like buttons, cards, inputs, and form logic.

##  How I Used AI in My Workflow

- I started by generating the full landing page layout using **Bolt.new**, which gave me a professional design with Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, and Contact sections.
- During setup, I ran into issues with folder structure and `package.json`. I used **ChatGPT** to debug those problems and understand how to properly run the project using `npm`.
- I also used ChatGPT to implement **scroll-to-section navigation** since everything is on a single page.
- GitHub Copilot helped me while editing and refactoring code — it suggested class names, props, and TypeScript types when writing reusable components.
- Finally, I used ChatGPT to help structure and write this AI Usage Report and the `README.md` file.

##  Sample Prompts I Used

1. "How to fix ‘npm install’ error: package.json not found?"
2. "How to scroll to sections in a single-page Next.js site using navbar?"
3. "Generate a README for a SaaS landing page built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS"

##  AI vs Manual Work Breakdown

- **AI-Generated (~60%)**:
  - Page layout and sections (via Bolt.new)
  - Utility class suggestions, scroll logic, animation setup
  - Documentation assistance (README + AI report)

- **Manual Work (~40%)**:
  - Fixed bugs and project structure issues
  - Tested and tweaked responsiveness manually
  - Customized layout spacing, animation timing, and component styles
  - Final touch-ups on UI, mobile breakpoints, hover states, and form validation

##  Customization Summary

- I rewrote and refined the Hero copy, features list, and pricing section text.
- Adjusted Tailwind breakpoints manually to improve mobile and tablet layout.
- Cleaned up project folder and ensured each component was reusable and clean.
- Added scroll behavior manually and tested navigation across all devices.
